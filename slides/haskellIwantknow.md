# 認真接觸haskell大概快一年了... #

# 前方還是漫漫長路... #

##[Erlang, Haskell, OCaml: screw one, marry one, kill one. Which and why](http://www.quora.com/Erlang-Haskell-OCaml-screw-one-marry-one-kill-one-Which-and-why)##

- When you were young, Haskell meant the world to you. Her passionate, firey idealism was all you ever wanted. You dreamt of spending long, passionate nights together.

- But while experience taught you that the world is neither simple nor rigid. Haskell never learned these lessons. She's a purely functional language out of academia, and that sort of passionate idealism you find extremely attractive. 

#沒錯！渡過了無數個夜晚!#




## 這是我接觸的第一本書 ##

- 還不錯..雖然Library有些許過時 

- 但是重要觀念是不會過時的!
