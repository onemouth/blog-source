Originally this blog was generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll), but after using it for a while, although I liked its concise and simple design, I still found some aspects not quite user-friendly. Recently, I happened to discover [Babashka](https://babashka.org), and I thought I could use Babashka and Pandoc CLI to implement the functionalities I used in Hakyll. This blog post mainly introduces my implementation. My implementation repository can be found [here](https://github.com/onemouth/blog-source).

# Hakyll

首先我想介紹我原本使用的Hakyll是如何運作的。Hakyll是一個Haskell Library，它本身提供了一些靜態網站生成器需要的helper function。


本身是一個基於Pandoc Libray的



# Babashka + Pandoc
